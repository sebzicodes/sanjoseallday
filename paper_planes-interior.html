    <h1>You have entered Paper Planes</h1>
    <p>
      As you walk in, you see casual but upscale setting. There is a large booth
      facing the front windows to your left and then a line of booths in
      succession along the wall extending deeper into the building. To your
      right is the bar, where all manor of patrons are ordering and drinking
      interesting cocktails. Walking a bit further in you see a little hallway
      off to your left and another booth in a sectioned off room. The back most
      part of the space holds a few hightops. There is another hallway beyond
      the hightops which you think must be the bathroom and kitchen area.
    </p>

      You make your way to the bartop, squeezing in beside your fellow bar
      goers. A dapper looking gentlman spots you and greets you promptly. "Hi
      there, I'm Miguel and ill be your bartender this evening! Is there
      anything that looks good on our spirit and cocktail list that i can get
      you?"
