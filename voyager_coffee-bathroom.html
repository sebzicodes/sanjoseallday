    <h1>You are inside the bathroom at Voyager Coffee</h1>
    <p>
      You walk into the bathroom and see a clean and well-maintained space. As
      you begin to use the facilities, you hear a knock at what you think is the
      door. You ignore it, but the knocking continues. While finishing up you
      say "I'll be out in a minute!"
    </p>
    <p>
      You start to wash your hands and notice the knocking isn't coming from the
      door but from behind the mirror. You look closer and see a small door
      behind the mirror. You open it and see a ladder leading down into a dark
      space.
