    <h1>You have arrived at Paper Planes</h1>
    <p>
      Walking up to the bar you see a long line to enter the bar. The security
      guards are checking patrons ID's at the door. Everyone waiting looks very
      excited to get in and have a drink. As you step over the tram track
      towards the back of the line you hear a horn whistle from the tram
      approaching. You step aside the tracks to allow the tram passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything around you seems very lively. You notice the crowd looks to be
      a lot of younger people with trending fashion sense. Some people in line
      are talking about their college classes, and some are talking about how
      incredible the drink was that they had last weekend at Paper Planes. As
      the line shortens and you near the door you begin to smell something
      amazing. A few minutes ago while you were waiting and socializing in line,
      a few hot dog stands have set up all along the block offering drunk bar
      goers a delicious reprieve from hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line was long but you find that time just flies by as you converse
      with the fellow bar goers waiting with you and now youre getting your I-D
      checked by a stern yet proffessional security gaurd. after close thorough
      inspection of your ID he says "Welcome in and enjoy your drink!"
