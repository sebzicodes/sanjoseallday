    <h1>You are at Santa Clara and First Street</h1>
    <p>
      You're standing on the corner of Santa Clara and First Street. You see
      groups of people walking, and a few lowriders driving down the street. You
      hear the bell of a train in the distance. You look around and see four
      different directions to go.
