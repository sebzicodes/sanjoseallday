    <h1>You are on the corner of San Fernando and Second Street</h1>
    <p>
      The midday sun bounced off the SAP Center's glass, momentarily blinding a
      man struggling to unfold a map. A food truck, "Tacos Al Pastor Dave,"
      blasted cumbia, its aroma battling the faint scent of stale churros from a
      nearby cart. A cluster of tech bros, lanyard-clad, zoomed past on electric
      scooters, narrowly missing a pigeon pecking at a discarded burrito. Across
      the street, the ornate facade of the California Theatre stood in quiet
      contrast, a relic of a different era, watching the Silicon Valley hustle
      unfold.
