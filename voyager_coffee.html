    <h1>You are at Voyager Coffee in San Pedro Square</h1>
    <p>
      You wait in line and order a coffee. The barista hands you your drink and
      you take a seat at a table outside. You see a group of people sitting at a
      table next to you, laughing and talking. You take a sip of your coffee and
      enjoy the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You finish your coffee and decide to continue exploring the city. You
      stand up and walk towards the street.
