    <h1>You are at Voyager Coffee in San Pedro Square</h1>
    <p>
      You get in line to order a coffee. There are tech bros all around you
      talking about how they're working on the next big thing and how they're
      going to make the world a better place. You order your coffee and take a
      seat at a table outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see a group of people sitting at a table next to you, laughing and
      talking. You take a sip of your coffee and enjoy the moment. You finish
      your coffee and decide to continue exploring the city. You stand up and
      start to walk towards the street.
